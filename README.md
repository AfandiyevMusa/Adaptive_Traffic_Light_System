# Adaptive Traffic Light System

## Overview

This project is an Adaptive Traffic Light System designed to optimize traffic flow based on real-time data. The system changes traffic light colors and directions dynamically, improving traffic management and reducing congestion.

## Requirements

- [SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) installed on your machine
- [Python]installed for running the script

## Running the Program

You can run the Adaptive Traffic Light System using one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Run the SUMO Configuration File Directly

1. Locate the `adaptive_traffic_light_system.sumocfg` file on your system.
2. Double-click on the file to open it in the SUMO GUI.
3. The simulation will start automatically.

### Method 2: Run the Python Script

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `sumo_run.py` file is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   python sumo_run.py

### Method 3: Use NetEdit to Edit and Run
1. Open the NetEdit application (part of the SUMO suite).
2. Choose the .XML file associated with the network you want to open.
3. Edit -> Open the file in the SUMO GUI to start the simulation.
